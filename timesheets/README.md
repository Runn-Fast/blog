# Syncing external timesheet solutions with Runn
 
Before you can start planning the future, you first need to know where you are…
and in a budget constrained environments, timesheets are a critical measurement
of how much time has actually been spent. 

Knowing this means we can forecast when a project is likely to be completed,
how much it’s going to cost us to deliver it & what the total bill is likely to
be for your clients (for external projects). We call this a blended forecast
(and it’s a bit smarter than what you might be use to) 
 
The blended forecast is calculated like this—

**Blended Forecast** =

- **Actual work** (The actual time recorded in timesheets) 
- **+ Assumed work** (time we are assuming was done, even though the timesheets are yet to be submitted)
- **+ Scheduled work** (all work this is planned in the future).
 
As you can see from the above formula, we can still create a forecast even
without timesheets – the problem is it’s likely not going to be a very good one
as won’t any record of timesheets being submitted, therefore we assume that all
the work was done exactly it was had planned — which is very rarely the case. 
 
So actuals are useful – but how do you get them into Runn? You have five options!
 
1. You can use Runn’s built in time sheeting tools and enter them directly into
   Runn.
2. You can import them via a CSV
3. Use one of our pre built integrations.
4. You can use a “No-Code” third party solution, such as Integromat
5. You leverage Runn’s API to connect with your existing time tracking tool,
   enabling you to pull data over.
 
Option 4 and 5 have the same benefits, so it’s largely down two which approach
fits your needs better. The key benefits to both are
 
1. **Not change management**. If you have a time sheeting tool that works, and
   everyone uses – changing to a new tool is going to be painful. With an API
   level connection, you don’t need anyone to change a thing. Code is often
   easier to change than people and processes!
2. **Faster onboarding & streamlined operations**. Time sheeting tools often
   have heaps of the same data Runn needs, people, projects, clients, actuals.
   Syncing this data means there is no room for data to be disconnected.
3. **Streamlined Migrations**. Even if you plan on to full migrate to Runn’s
   timesheeting solution in the future, by keeping the two solutions in sync,
   you can take your time running both systems in tandem till you are ready to
   decommission the old one. 

Now we understand why this stuff matters, let's get into a real world example,
building out an API with to Toggle, a popular time tracking tool.
